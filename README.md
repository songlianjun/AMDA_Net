## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Datasets

1. Synapse Dataset:
   You can directly download this dataset following this link.http://synapse.apache.org/download.html or you can use the Synapse datasets from other projects by TransUnet's authors. (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ACJEoTp-uqfFJ73qS3eUObQh52nGuzCd).
   
2. ACDC Dataset:
   You can directly download this dataset following this link.https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/Challenge/acdc/
   
## Training

>ðŸ“‹ Give a link to where/how the pretrained models can be downloaded and how they were trained (if applicable).  Alternatively you can have an additional column in your results table with a link to the models.You need to download the pretrained-model by this link and put it into the folder of "pretrained_ckpt/" :https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApI0vb6wPqmtgrl-pI8MPFoll-ueNQ?e=bpdieu
To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python train.py --cfg [config_file in configs]
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.

## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

```eval
python test.py --cfg [pretrained_config_file in configs]
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :

### [Image Classification on ImageNet](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet)

| Model name         | Top 1 Accuracy  | Top 5 Accuracy |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |
| My awesome model   |     85%         |      95%       |

>ðŸ“‹  Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it.
